# 001 — Airport Weather (Open-Meteo)

**Goal:** Learn API wrangling → pandas → a quick matplotlib chart. Later, tie weather to delays.

**Plan (v0):**
1. Fetch 7-day hourly weather for CLT (Open-Meteo).
2. Put into pandas, plot temperature.
3. Add wind/visibility next and save a PNG.

Why it matters: weather drives ops. Even a toy API chart is step one toward delay prediction.
