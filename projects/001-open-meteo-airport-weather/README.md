# 001 — Airport Weather (Open-Meteo)

**Goal:** Learn API wrangling + pandas + a quick matplotlib chart. Later, relate weather to delays.

## Steps (coming next)
1) Fetch 7-day hourly weather for CLT using Open-Meteo.
2) Put into pandas, plot temperature.
3) Add wind/visibility next.

## Why it matters
Weather drives ops. Even a tiny API chart is step one toward delay prediction and decision support.

**Files:**
- `fetch_weather.py` — prints first 5 rows from Open-Meteo
